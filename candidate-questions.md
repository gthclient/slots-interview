# Slot Machine Coding Challenge

Please complete the following tasks as part of the slot machine coding challenge.

## 1. Chip Types and Selection

Implement a system that supports multiple types of betting chips, each with different values and visual styles. Allow users to select a chip, and ensure the selected chip is visually highlighted.

## 2. Prevent Negative Balance

Update the game logic to ensure that a user’s balance can never become negative. Prevent spins if the user does not have enough balance to cover their bet.

## 3. Prevent Multiple Spins

Modify the spin functionality so that a new spin cannot be triggered while a spin is already in progress. This prevents accidental or rapid multiple spins.

## 4. Win Evaluation Logic

Implement the logic to evaluate whether the current reel state results in a win. Calculate the winnings based on the symbols and paylines, and update the user’s balance accordingly.
